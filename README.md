- **styles**: Contains styles using React Native's `StyleSheet` to manage the app's appearance, including dark and light theme styles.
- **Button Component**: A reusable button component for handling user input.

## Usage

- **Input Digits**: Tap on the number buttons (0-9) to enter digits.
- **Perform Operations**: Tap the operators (`+`, `-`, `ร`, `รท`) to perform calculations.
- **Toggle Theme**: Click on the sun/moon icon in the top right corner to switch between dark and light themes.
- **Clear**: Tap on the `AC` button to clear the display and reset the calculator.

## Key Functions

- **inputDigit**: Updates the display with the pressed digit.
- **inputDecimal**: Adds a decimal point to the current display.
- **clearDisplay**: Resets the calculator state.
- **performOperation**: Handles arithmetic operations based on user input.
- **calculate**: Performs the specified operation between two numbers.

## Customization

You can customize the app by:

- Modifying button styles in the `styles` object.
